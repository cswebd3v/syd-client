Save Your Darlings is an app created for writers and world builders, to help them create and visualize their fictional characters.
![Preview](./src/images/intro.png)

Users start by selecting a face to work with. Faces can be sorted by gender as well as age group. Depending on the selection, the user can move through multiple pages of faces.

In the second section, the user describes their character using a series of questions.

Next, the user names their character. They can either supply their own name, or use the name generator that is provided.

Lastly, the user will save their darling. This will download an image file with all of the compiled information that was put together in the first three steps. It is recommended that the user keeps all of these images in a folder for future reference.
